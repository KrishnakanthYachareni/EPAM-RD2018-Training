/**
 * This package contains week two all general tasks implementation
 * Those tasks are as follows:
 * 
 *  # Task1: FizzBuzz
 *  	The FizzBuzz class can print 1 to 100. If number can be divided by 3, print "Fizz"
 *		If divide by 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number, If both condition holds, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
 * 		Sample Output:
 * 		1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz ...13 14 Buzz
 * 
 * # Task2: Collatz Sequence
 * 		The CollatzSequence class can accept command line argument and should produce 
 * 		collatz sequence starting from a_0 = N (N<100)until a_n = 1.
 * 		an = {(1/2)an-1 for an-1 even
 * 		{3an-1+1 for odd
 * 
 * 		Sample output:
 * 		> java Collatz 3
 * 		3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
 * 		> java Collatz 5
 * 		5 16 8 4 2 1
 * 		> java Collatz 7
 * 		7 22 11 34 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1 
 * 
 * # Task3: Temperature
 * 		The CelsiusFahrenheit class can accept only two command line arguments 
 * 		if we pass more than two will raise an exception.
 * 		If parameter is 0 then can convert the second parameter from celsius to fahrenheit, 
 * 		otherwise it can reverse the conversion.   
 * 		The way to do the first conversion is the following: C = (F-32) * 5 / 9 
 * 		# first parameter should be int.
 * 		# second parameter should be float.
 * 
 * # Task4: Perfect Number
 * 		The PerfectNumber class can check given number is perfect number or not.
 * 		(a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, 1 included, the number is excluded.)  
 * 		The four smallest such integers are 6, 28, 496, 8128.
